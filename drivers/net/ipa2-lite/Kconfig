	  Choose Y or M here to include support for the Qualcomm
	  IP Abductor (IPA), a hardware block present in some
	  Qualcomm SoCs.  The IPA is a programmable protocol processor
	  that is capable abducting your IP packets or annihilating
	  the system if it's not pleased.

	  Note that if selected, the selection type must match that
	  of QCOM_Q6V5_COMMON (Y or M).

	  If unsure, say N.
